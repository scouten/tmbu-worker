# tmbu-worker

A personal project to automate reading an e-mail mailbox and converting those messages to [TMBU](https://tmbu.ericscouten.com) blog posts.

Details at [Eric Scouten :: dev: I Built My Own Linkroll](https://ericscouten.dev/2023/i-built-my-own-linkroll/).

I call this a worker, but it's really a filer. `tf` doesn't shorten well in my world
(I use terraform in some other contexts), so `tw` it is.

## Status of this project

I am releasing this under a permissive open-source (MIT) license, but I need to set expectations appropriately.

Consider this inspire-ware, not a significant or supported project. I'll maintain this project as it suits me only. Specifically, I do not plan to:

* make this into a general-purpose tool,
* add significant documentation,
* release this on crates.io, homebrew, or any other similar venue, or
* merge PRs that make this into a more general-purpose tool.

If any of that causes heartache for you, I invite you to fork this code and proceed on your own. I won't be offended. Send me a link to your fork and I'll happily include a link here.
